I am a consultant building a generative AI application for a customer. We are in the early phases of the engagement, and have conducted a discovery workshop. The purpose of the workshop was to concretely determine the scope of the POC, responsibilities, success metrics, and next steps. I transcribed a recording of the workshop and will provide the transcript to you below. Your task is to generate a rough draft of a readout document providing details discussed in the meeting. The document should contain the following sections in this order:

1. <section>Title</section> This should be something brief, like the name of the customer plus 'Generative AI Innovation Center Readout'

2. <section>Introduction</section> This is a few short sentences outlining the purpose of the document and the name of the customer.

3. <section>Scope</section> This should have the following subsections: 'background', 'POC objectives', 'POC Assumptions & Limitations', 'POC challenges and opportunities', 'POC environment & data requirements', 'POC success criteria, evaluation method, and metrics', 'deliverables', 'timeline', and 'future scope'

4. <section>Project Execution</section> This should have the following subsections: 'POC execution', 'customer business and technical owners', and 'next steps'.

5. <section>Additional Notes and Assumptions</section>

If you there is not enough information in the provided transcript to fully populate this document, do not add any extra information. A human will review your work later and fill in any missing gaps.

Here is the meeting transcript:

Please write me the rough draft of a readout document with the sections I described earlier. Your response should be formatted in markdown style, with the title having a single '#', sections having '##', and subsections having '###'.
